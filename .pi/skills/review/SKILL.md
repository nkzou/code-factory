# Review PR

Announce: "I'm using the review skill to review a GitHub pull request."

## Context

- Current branch: !`git branch --show-current`
- Repository: !`basename $(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)`
- Remote URL: !`git remote get-url origin 2>/dev/null || echo "no remote"`

## Step 1: Verify Prerequisites

Run in parallel:
- `gh auth status 2>&1`
- `git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>&1`

**If `gh` is not installed or not authenticated:** inform the user that the `gh` CLI is required (`gh auth login`). Stop.

**If not a git repository:** inform the user and stop.

## Step 2: Identify the PR

Determine the PR from `$ARGUMENTS`:

| Input | Action |
|-------|--------|
| Number (e.g., `123`) | Use directly |
| URL (e.g., `github.com/.../pull/123`) | Extract the number |
| Branch name | `gh pr list --head <branch> --json number --jq '.[0].number'` |
| Empty | `gh pr view --json number --jq '.number' 2>/dev/null` |

**If no PR found:** use AskUserQuestion to request a PR number, URL, or branch name. List recent PRs with `gh pr list --limit 5` as suggestions.

## Step 3: Fetch PR Details

Run in parallel:
- `gh pr view <number> --json title,body,baseRefName,headRefName,author,additions,deletions,changedFiles,url,labels`
- `gh pr diff <number>`

## Step 3b: Classify Complexity

Determine the review complexity tier from the PR details fetched in Step 3:

| Tier | Criteria | Review Depth |
|------|----------|-------------|
| **Simple** | 1-3 files, single concern | Quick scan: correctness and security only |
| **Medium** | 4-10 files or multiple concerns | Standard review: all analysis categories |
| **Complex** | 11+ files, cross-cutting changes, or architectural | Deep review: all categories + architecture analysis + data flow tracing |

**Critical path detection:** Auto-escalate to at least Medium tier if any changed file path contains: `auth`, `security`, `permission`, `payment`, `billing`, `migration`, `schema`, `validator`, `sanitiz`, `crypto`, `secret`, `credential`. Also escalate if the PR title or labels mention security fixes, breaking changes, or data integrity.

**Multiple critical paths:** When changed files match multiple critical path patterns (e.g., both `auth` and `payment`), escalate to the deepest tier any single match triggers. Review each critical domain as a separate concern — a PR touching auth AND billing needs both analyzed independently.

## Step 4: Build Review

Analyze the diff and construct the review using the format below. Scale analysis depth to the complexity tier from Step 3b: Simple PRs focus on correctness and security; Medium PRs cover all categories; Complex PRs add architecture analysis and data flow tracing.

### Output Format

<output-format>

## PR Review: <title>

**PR:** <url>
**Author:** <author>
**Base:** <baseRefName> ← <headRefName>
**Changes:** +<additions> -<deletions> across <changedFiles> files

---

### Narrative Summary

*Include for Medium and Complex PRs. Omit for Simple PRs.*

<2-4 sentences explaining what this PR does end-to-end, its overall quality assessment, and the key areas that need attention. This orients the reader before they encounter individual findings. Write in plain prose, not bullet points.>

---

### Goal

<1-3 sentences explaining what this PR accomplishes and why. Focus on intent, not implementation details. If the PR body contains useful context, incorporate it here.>

---

### Interface Changes

| Change | Type | Compatibility | Location |
|--------|------|---------------|----------|
| <what changed> | <API/struct/interface/param> | Additive or Breaking | `file:line` |

**Include:** Public API changes, exported types, HTTP endpoints, CLI flags, config schema changes.
**Exclude:** Internal structs, private functions, implementation details.

If none, write "None."

---

### Database / Schema Changes

| Change | Location | Migration Required |
|--------|----------|-------------------|
| <table/column/index change> | `file` | Yes/No |

If none, write "None."

---

### Findings

Tag each finding with a confidence level:

| Confidence | Criteria | Examples |
|-----------|----------|---------|
| **HIGH** | Definite issue supported by code evidence | Bug, security flaw, broken contract, type error, null dereference |
| **MEDIUM** | Likely issue based on patterns or context | Code smell, missing edge case, probable race condition, questionable design |
| **LOW** | Subjective observation or style preference | Alternative approach, naming preference, optional refactor |

#### Critical

Issues that must be fixed before merge.

| Category | Confidence | Location | Issue | Suggestion |
|----------|-----------|----------|-------|------------|
| <Correctness/Security/etc> | HIGH/MEDIUM | `file:line` | <description> | <fix> |

#### Suggestions

Improvements that would strengthen the PR.

| Category | Confidence | Location | Issue | Suggestion |
|----------|-----------|----------|-------|------------|
| <Design/Testing/etc> | HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW | `file:line` | <description> | <fix> |

#### Nits

Minor style or consistency points.

| Confidence | Location | Note |
|-----------|----------|------|
| MEDIUM/LOW | `file:line` | <description> |

Omit any severity section with no entries.

### Test Coverage

| New/Changed Behavior | Test Coverage |
|---------------------|---------------|
| <feature or code path> | Covered / Missing / Partial |

---

### Impact Assessment

**Customer-facing:** <Changes visible to end users, API consumers, or external behavior. "None" if purely internal.>

**Internal:** <Refactors, tooling, developer experience, or internal APIs.>

---

### Verdict

**<Approve / Request Changes / Comment>**

<1-2 sentence rationale>

## Analysis Categories

When reviewing, evaluate against:

<analysis-categories>

| Category | Look For |
|----------|----------|
| **Correctness** | Logic errors, nil/null risks, off-by-one, missing error handling, race conditions (e.g., shared mutable state without locks, concurrent map access, check-then-act without atomicity) |
| **Security** | Hardcoded secrets, injection vectors (SQL/XSS), insecure deserialization, overly permissive access |
| **Design** | Over-engineering, missing abstractions, pattern inconsistency, poor separation of concerns |
| **Testing** | Missing coverage, untested edge cases, weak assertions, brittle tests |
| **Style** | Unclear naming, dead code, misleading comments, formatting inconsistency |

</analysis-categories>

## Rules

- Reference exact file paths and line numbers from the diff.
- Be constructive: suggest fixes, not only problems.
- Format the review output with semantic line breaks: one sentence per line, break after clause-separating punctuation. Target 120 characters per line. This keeps review text clean when pasted or posted.
- Do NOT post the review as a GitHub comment automatically. Present it to the user.
- If no findings exist, state that and recommend approval.

## Error Handling

| Error | Action |
|-------|--------|
| `gh` not installed/authenticated | Inform user to run `gh auth login`. Stop. |
| PR not found | Report error. List recent PRs with `gh pr list --limit 5`. |
| Empty or binary-only diff | Report that the PR contains no reviewable text changes. List the binary files. |
| Network/API failure | Report the `gh` error message. Let user retry. |
